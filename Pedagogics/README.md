This directory contains code written to demonstrate some of the underlying ideas behind our statistical analysis.

The current contents of this directory are:

`README.md`: This text

`coin_tossing.py`: A module that demonstrated the difference between Bayesian and frequentist hypothesis testing, using the example of determining whether a coin is weighted

`differences.py`: A module demonstrating the idea behind looking at the difference between two distributions that describe the effectiveness of two interventions

`D_illustration_script.py`: A script that uses the `differences` module to generate the plots used in the internal _Demokratisk Digitalisering_ document `Statistisk analys
av kvalitetsskillnader`.

`parameter_fitting.py`: A module implementing a toy model that demonstrates the difference between a number of different methods of parameter fitting.

`PF_illustration_script.py`: A script that runs the `parameter_fitting` module with some convenient starting values.
