This directory contains code written to demonstrate some of the underlying ideas behind our statistical analysis.

The current contents of this directory are:

`README.md`: This text

`differences.py`: Module demonstrating the idea behind looking at the difference between two distributions that describe the effectiveness of two interventions

`D_illustration_script.py`: Script that uses the `differences` module to generate the plots used in the internal _Demokratisk Digitalisering_ document `Statistisk analys
av kvalitetsskillnader`.

`hypothesis_testing.py`: Module that demonstrates the difference between Bayesian and frequentist hypothesis testing. This is to a large extend modelled after `differences.py`, above.

`HT_illustration_script.py`: Script that uses the `hypothesis_testing` module to generate the plots used in the internal _Demokratisk Digitalisering_ document `Bayesianska och frekventistiska nollhypotestester`.


`parameter_fitting.py`: Module implementing a toy model that demonstrates the difference between a number of different methods of parameter fitting.

`PF_illustration_script.py`: Script that runs the `parameter_fitting` module with some convenient starting values.
