This repository contains code written for the ESF-financed project _Demokratisk Digitalisering_. The project is a collaboration between Arbetsförmedlingen (AF) and Kungliga Tekniska Högskolan (KTH). The purpose of the project is to increase the digital competence - as defined at https://ec.europa.eu/jrc/en/digcomp - of people working at AF, and by extension also job seekers. This will be done by learning modules at KTH using OLI-Torus.

The current contents of the repository are:

`README.md`: This text

`demodigi.py`: Python module for analysing the results of the study that we will eventually do. It can also be used for simulating similar studies, to test that the analysis at least makes sense on paper.

`demodigi_test_script.py`: Script intended as a test of the module `demodigi.py`, by implementing a simple simulated study. It can also be seen as a demo of how to use the module. To make that easier, it has verbose comments explaining what happens at every step along the way.
