This repository contains code written for the ESF-financed project Demokratisk Digitalisering. The project is a collaboration between Arbetsförmedlingen (AF) and Kungliga Tekniska Högskolan (KTH). The purpose of the project is to increase the digital competence - as defined at https://ec.europa.eu/jrc/en/digcomp - of people working at Arbetsförmedlingen, and by extension also job seekers. This will be done by learning modules at KTH using OLI-Torus.

The current contents of the repository are:

`README.md`: This file

`demodigi.py`: This is a Python module that simulates the study that we will eventually do. It is intended to test that the statistical analysis we are planning to make at least works on paper. I plan to expand it so that it can be used both for simulating studies and analysing actual data.

`demodigi_test_script.py`: This is a script intended as a test of the module `demodigi.py`, by implementing a simple simulated study. It can also be seen as a demo of how to use the module. To make that easier, it has verbose comments explaining what happens at every step along the way.
