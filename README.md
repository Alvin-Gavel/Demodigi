This repository contains code written for the ESF-financed project Demokratisk Digitalisering. The project is a collaboration between Arbetsförmedlingen (AF) and Kungliga Tekniska Högskolan (KTH). The purpose of the project is to increase the digital competence - as defined at https://ec.europa.eu/jrc/en/digcomp - of people working at Arbetsförmedlingen, and by extension also job seekers. This will be done by learning modules at KTH using OLI-Torus.

Both the Python module demodigi and the Python script contain a detailed explanation of what they do, and why.
