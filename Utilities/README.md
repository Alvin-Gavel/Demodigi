This directory contains code written for some specific technical purpose, such as handling the data output by OLI Torus. Since it is of no scientific interest, it is stored separately from the other code.

The current contents of this directory are:

`README.md`: This text

`canvas_contact.py`: Module for interacting with the Canvas API, typically to provide individual feedback to the course participants

`extra_functions.py`: Module with useful little functions that do not fit anywhere else

`preprocessing.py`: Module for handling the data that comes out of OLI-Torus, changing it into a format suitable for the `factorial_experiment` module one level further up

`sensitive_data_management`: Module for handling person numbers and similar information

`user_data_script`: Script that does the routine work related to creating users on Canvas

`user_access_script`: Script for the routine task of renewing access for users who have lost it for some reason

`KL_script`: Script that does the routine work related to the course module Kartl√§ggning

`Obsolete`: Directory containing code that we no longer expect to need

`Feedback_paragraphs`: Directory containing text files with the individual paragraphs that are combined when generating feedback to the individual users
