This directory contains code written for some specific technical purpose, such as automatically creating a SharePoint page. Since it is of no scientific interest, it is stored separately from the other code.

The current contents of this directory are:

`README.md`: This text

`employees.py`: A module for figuring out the organisational positions of the employees at AF

`preprocessing.py`: A module for handling the data that comes out of OLI-Torus, changing it into a format suitable for the factorial_experiment module one level further up

`sharepoint_robot.py`: A module for creating SharePoint pages to share passwords with participants in the project
