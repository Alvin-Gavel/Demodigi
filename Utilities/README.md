This directory contains code written for some specific technical purpose, such as handling the data output by OLI Torus. Since it is of no scientific interest, it is stored separately from the other code.

The current contents of this directory are:

`README.md`: This text

`canvas_contact.py`: Module for interacting with the Canvas API, typically to provide individual feedback to the course participants

`preprocessing.py`: Module for handling the data that comes out of OLI-Torus, changing it into a format suitable for the `factorial_experiment` module one level further up

`PP_KL_script`: Script that handles the results of the course module `kartläggning`

`PP_IS_script`: Script that handles the results of the course module `IT-säkerhet`

`single_sign_on.py`: Module for interacting with the SSO that we use for logging in to Canvas

`Obsolete`: Directory containing code that we no longer expect to need

`Feedback_paragraphs`: Directory containing text files with the individual paragraphs that are combined when generating feedback to the individual users
