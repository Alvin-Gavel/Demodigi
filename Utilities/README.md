This directory contains code written for some specific technical purpose, such as handling the data output by OLI Torus. Since it is of no scientific interest, it is stored separately from the other code.

The current contents of this directory are:

`README.md`: This text

`preprocessing.py`: Module for handling the data that comes out of OLI-Torus, changing it into a format suitable for the `factorial_experiment` module one level further up

`PP_KL_script`: Script that handles the results of the course module `kartläggning`

`PP_IS_script`: Script that handles the results of the course module `IT-säkerhet`

`Obsolete`: Directory containing code that we no longer expect to need
