This module was written for the ESF-financed project Demokratisk
Digitalisering. The project is a collaboration between
Arbetsförmedlingen (AF) and Kungliga Tekniska Högskolan (KTH). The
purpose of the project is to increase the digital competence - as
defined at https://ec.europa.eu/jrc/en/digcomp - of people working at
Arbetsförmedlingen, and by extension also job seekers. This will be
done by learning modules at KTH using OLI-Torus.

--- About this Python module ---
